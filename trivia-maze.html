  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Over the summer of 2023, I was half of a two-man team that created a trivia maze 
    game for our Software Development and QA Techniques junior capstone course. 
    The primary technologies used were Java Swing, utilizing SQLite as our database, 
    and followed both the Model-View-Controller and Factory design patterns. <br><br>

    Developed over a shortened 8-week quarter, we learned valuable technical skills 
    like serialization and new productivity-tracking tools, and how to efficiently 
    work as a team. Relying on one another, maintaining effective communication, and 
    adapting to troubleshooting at a rapid pace was crucial to our success.

  <h3>User Stories</h3>
  <p>Part of the project requirements included creating user stories. The format we 
    followed compiled user needs collected from ourselves, classmates, and friends who also 
    assisted us in testing our game. For each of these, we would calculate the amount of time 
    and code that it would take to implement, consider alternative methods of meeting or 
    mitigating the impact of the feature in our timeline.

  <p>The structure of our project is detailed in our Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagram. 
    UMLs are a commonly used visual representation of code, created to assist understanding 
    aspects of a system’s architecture. Our diagram specifically highlights the methods of 
    each class, the relationships between the logic controllers and the UI of our project, 
    and the flow of information.
  </p>
  <h3 id="factory">Factory Design Pattern</h3>
  <p>The Trivia Maze uses the Factory design pattern to generate questions in the game. 
    Factories are useful when implementing multiple objects with similar attributes. Each of our 
    questions is accompanied by its type, correct answer, and incorrect answer(s) (when applicable). 
    Since the maze is randomized, our logic controller retrieves a question from the database each time 
    a user enters a “room”, so the dead ends are determined by the player’s skills!

  <h3 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h3>
  <img src="../assets/images/Lose.png" alt="Lose condition" class="align-right" width="450px">
  <p>Developing this project came with numerous difficulties and challenges to overcome. 
    As the only group of 2 in a class full of 3-person teams, we felt an enormous amount of pressure
     to perform up to the standards that were placed on us. Determined to not let our small size stop 
     us from succeeding, we maintained in almost constant contact throughout the quarter over 
     multiple modes of communication. We were able to formulate an agile sprint cycle that worked 
     for both of our schedules among outside obligations and work from other classes.
  </p>
  <h3 id="mvc">Model-View-Controller design pattern</h3>
  <p>About halfway through the quarter, we found ourselves drowning in a pile of Java objects, 
     overcomplicated datapaths, and more code Band-Aids than we could count. Over one of our 
     longest meetings, we swallowed our pride and returned to the core functionality of the game.
      We weighed features we wanted to include and aspects that were required for the game to
       perform against our remaining timeline. Concluding that we may have been quick to 
       jump into the trenches of programming, we began the implementation of the 
       Model-View-Controller design pattern. Concisely, MVC removes the bulk of the 
       program from the front-facing code, instead organizing the logic in the Model. 
       The Controller serves as an intermediary, handling user input from the View and performing updates to the Model as needed, then directing the View to reflect the necessary changes back to the user. Using this structure greatly increased the efficiency of our objects and methods, and despite the initial learning curve it made for much more readable code. It was a difficult decision, although by the end the transition allowed for practicing industry-level principles and taught us to further develop the higher level planning of our project.
  </p>
  <h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
  <p>For our database needs we made use of SQLite, a lightweight database management 
    system that is contained as a single file in the program itself, rather than needing 
    to be outsourced to a fully comprehensive DBMS. I primarily worked on this part of the 
    project, and as I had only lightly touched on the topic before, it was a lesson in
     combining technologies and ensuring data validation across the system. I have 
     since been able to use SQLite in other projects, much better prepared due to my 
     experience developing the Trivia Maze. <br><br>
    <img src="../assets/images/Load.png" alt="Load menu" class="align-left" width="300px">
     My teammate implemented serialization for saving and loading instances of the game.
      Shortly stated, serialization is the optimized conversion of the game’s current state
       into a condensed version, able to be easily stored and retrieved for future use. 
       This process was very in-depth, as it required all state-having objects in our code 
       to be serialized and neatly organized in the database, then redeployed upon loading a save file.

  <p>This project was essential for my growth as a student, programmer, and designer. 
    Managing components of a program on a scale of which I had not contributed to before 
    was intimidating and at times I struggled to make forward progress. Being a summer 
    course, time was limited, resources were largely self-sourced, and my attention was 
    competed for by stolen moments of summer vacation. I am grateful to have had the
     opportunity to work on this project with my friend, who supported me as I 
     supported him through these challenges. It strengthened my perseverance, 
     encouraged me to think creatively to solve formulaic problems, and proved the 
     value of structural design as a prerequisite for the following operational tasks. 
     This case not only expanded my technical skills and problem-solving abilities 
     but also highlighted the importance of collaboration, perseverance, and
      thoughtful design in software development.
