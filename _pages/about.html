    <p>Hey, I'm Keegan! I'm a Clinical Robot Technician, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. 
        I've worked on numerous projects ranging from web design using HTML/CSS and JavaScript and programming Android apps and SQL databases, 
        to UX/UI work, designing for accessibility with community and state-level stakeholders.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Innovation & Design. 
        There, I gained experience working in teams and individually to meet technical spcifications and user needs.
        My nontraditional approach to Computer Science has allowed me to approach problems with user-centric design 
        principles and implementing those ideas with technological skills.
        My professional experience also includes working in multiple fast-paced, customer-focused environments for almost 8 years.
        Much of that work has beeen in a supervisory role, where I've learned administrative and leadership skills.
        I currently work in hospitals, where I monitor and troubleshoot autonomous delivery robots and 
        work with clients to ensure their needs are met.       
    </p>
  
    <h3>Personal Background</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Olympia, Washington, where I grew up reading and playing baseball and lacrosse. 
        In high school, I joined an after-school coding club, where I learned the basics and found my direction for college.
        I've always enjoyed working with my hands and thinking creatively, and pursuing my minor in Innovation & Design 
        has allowed me to explore those interests in conjunction with learning software development.
        I also love the outdoors that Washington offers, and on a day off I can be found on a lake, camping, or snowboarding!
