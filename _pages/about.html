    <p>Hey, I'm Keegan! I'm a Clinical Robot Technician, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. 
        I've worked on numerous projects ranging from web design in HTML/CSS and programming in Java and SQL, 
        to designing for accessibility with community and state-level stakeholders.

    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
    <p>I graduated from The University of Washington with a degree in Computer Science and Innovation & Design. 
        My journey in this field began when I journeyed down the unconventional road of earning a Bachelor of Arts
         in a predominantly scientific dicipline. Approaching problems with user-centric design principles and implementing those ideas with technological skills.
