        <p>Moxi is an autonomous delivery robot that works in hospital environments to assist healthcare workers. 
            It is capable of navigating high traffic areas and operating badge scanners and elevator buttons to 
            deliver medications, labs, and supplies so staff can focus on patient care. Deployed in almost 
            40 hospitals nationwide, Moxi alleviates repetitive tasks and minimizes the need for human
             transportation labor in a setting of healthcare professionals.
        
            My role is two-part. I work onsite to monitor and troubleshoot technical issues that may occur 
            with the robots, and report data to remote teams for Moxi improvements. I also work closely with 
            hospital staff to ensure that the user experience is intuitive and efficient. We conduct trainings 
            and resolve UX issues such as badging, social interactions, and answer any other questions staff may have.
        </p>
        <p>In October of 2023, a Moxi in New York took a gravity-assisted shortcut and set off a mad rush 
            for a better solution than the precautions already in place. Testing began at the Texas headquarters,
             and data collection was outsourced to priority hospitals to ensure this incident was never repeated. 
             
             The existing strategy involved training Moxi’s internal map, drawing so-called “red lines” to tell 
             Moxi to avoid high-risk areas of the building such as staircases. The incident occurred when Moxi 
             placed itself incorrectly on this particular floor’s onboard map after travelling on an elevator,
              and so did not register the red-lined area.
        </p>
        <p>As a priority hospital, my team was asked to assist with onsite testing for the stair detection system.
             This testing consisted of a few methods, one of which was playing a game of chicken with Moxi. 
             Using a remote, I maneuvered the robot towards different staircases to capture distance and speed thresholds. 
             I also did stress testing near pain points where false positives would trigger, to collect data 
             about environmental impacts to the system. Passive monitoring was also used to record what the sensors
              would identify as stairs and when.

            Multiple types of sensors for the system were considered and tested, however a setup of a 3D LiDAR 
            paired with special reflective tape was ultimately chosen for its wide beam, robust build, and ability 
            to not be confused by ceiling light reflections, as was observed with alternative sensors. 
            Additionally, Moxi was fitted with a gyroscope set to trigger the stair detector when Moxi tips past a
             certain angle, e-braking the robot and serving as a failsafe to the sensor. When the stair detector
              is set off, the robot will freeze in place and an operator must check Moxi’s surroundings to make 
              sure there are no stairs, or move it to a safe location and resume the robot’s navigation.
            
            The update was quickly rolled out fleetwide, and has since received additional updates based off of 
            continued testing.
            </p>
            <p>Moving forward, the current solution is far from perfect. While there haven’t been any more 
                incidents, further testing and updates are planned to improve Moxi’s behavior and reduce 
                the risk of falls. Current pain points include elevator thresholds and uneven floors
                 that tip Moxi and trigger the stair detector. Onsite teams such as mine keep an eye
                  out for positives and false positives, and report our findings back to headquarters.
                   On a few occasions, I have worked directly with a remote engineer on these pain points,
                    stress testing and helping calibrate the sensitivity of the system so Moxi can most 
                    effectively serve its users.
            </p>
            <p>As an iterative design, Moxi is always being improved and updated, and in my role I am able 
                to contribute a client-side view, armed with the knowledge and skills of design and development. 
                Serving as part of the testing process rewarded me with a closer look into an example in the
                 industry, and has been a valuable experience to take with me into my future career. Thank you.
