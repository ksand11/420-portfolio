    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>During the Winter 2024 quarter, I participated in a group of four to create a design that would assist older adults experiencing dementia while walking parks and trails. Favoring an analog approach in hopes that users would interact with our design more intuitively, we created a template for navigational and informational signs to be placed around parks. Iterating our project through the experience of user-oriented design thinking, a stakeholder interview, and user testing, we presented a product to peers and stakeholders that represented an important development in my education of design principles.</p>
    <h4 id="silver">What is Silver Linings?</h4>
    <p>Silver Linings Integrative Health is a company that provides personalized, trauma-informed care to older adults. Encouraging mobility, positive mental health, and spiritual wellness, Silver Linings offers individual and community-based care and activities for those aiming to take an active role in their aging and health journeys. The company is run by Dr. Adrienne Ione, a geriatric health practitioner focused on promoting healthy aging and physical and mental well-being across all ages.Through her work she empowers individuals to achieve a balanced and sustainable life.</p>
    <h2 id="problem">The Problem</h2>
    <p>While navigating parks and trails, there is often the chance of getting lost partway through a hike. Additionally, many park facilities such as bathrooms or first aid are not always effectively marked or advertised to people walking. The various situations that require that information can range from inconvenient to deadly, even more so when considering adults who may not have the same physical ability or memory retention as others. The problem we chose to address was that of the 75 year old man walking his local trails, needing water, a bathroom, or an exit, and being unable to safely navigate his way through. </p>

    <h4 id="interview">Stakeholder Interview</h4>
    <p>As part of our user research, we interviewed community members of Silver Linings and its founder, Dr. Adrienne Ione. From this interview, we gained valuable insight into the perspective of our target users, learning what was important to them and what pain points they experienced in the process of walking and hiking. Additionally, we were able to compile a list of specifications for our design that accurately addressed the use cases we identified.</p>

    <h4 id="part">My Part</h4>
    <p>My contribution towards this project was largely collaborative, as our group did much of the work together. However, when work was delegated, I was responsible for the overall concept of the design, incorporating the sectioned elements of information to provide a consistent layout for users. Additionally, I compiled the list of features to be included in each section, and collected visual assets to increase language access through the use of universal symbols.</p>
